## Overview

An operating system is a layer of software that manages hardware resources and that provides user programs with a simple and consistent interface to the machine. In this course, we will examine the services and abstractions commonly provided by operating systems, and we will study the underlying mechanisms used to implement them. Topics include processes and threads, synchronization, cpu scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, segmentation and paging systems, storage and file systems, distributed systems, and virtualization.
 
The concepts presented in class will be explored through a series of two intensive programming assignments and regular homework. The understanding of different concepts taught in class with be tested through regular quizzes. The assignments will make use of the C programming language, which the universal language for implementing and accessing operating systems at the lowest level. The projects and homework will give students ample practice in manipulating pointers, managing memory, invoking system services, and dealing with error conditions. Although we will offer some technical guidance on these matters, students should expect to spend significant time debugging, consulting reference materials, and revising their works until they work properly.


##  Learning objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Describe the basic components of a modern operating system.

- Understand the symbiotic relationship between computer architecture and operating system design.

- Discuss how operating systems provide abstractions for virtualization, concurrency, and persistence.

- Construct applications that utilize processes, threads, interprocess communication, and synchronization primitives to solve problems requiring concurrent or parallel computation.

- Explain how resources such as CPU time and memory are allocated and managed by the operating system.

- Evaluate the trade-offs embedded in different operating system techniques, algorithms, and data structures.

- Analyse the performance of applications in a variety of system contexts.

## Attendance Policy
To succeed in this class, you should attend and actively participate in all the scheduled lectures. You will get the most out of class if you have done the required readings in advance and actively take notes during class. 

Please refrain from using your laptops for non-class activities, since this tends to distract others as well as yourself. Letâ€™s use this time to work together instead.

Standard London Undergraduate Program attendance policies apply. Students are expected to be present at every class. In case of illness, please contact the Undergraduate Program Office straightaway. Unexcused absences will result in academic penalties on a scale from a deduction in your class participation grade, to a partial letter grade drop in your final grade for the class (e.g. an A would become an A minus, an A minus would become a B plus).

## Grading
|  Assessment| # of assessments | Weightage  | 
|---|---|---|
| Quizzes | 7  | 15%  (1.5 *10)  | 
|Homework | 2 |15%     (7.5 *2)| 
| Projects |3 | 30% (10 * 3)  |  
|  Midterm | 1 | 20%  | 
|   Final | 1|  20% |  

The course grade will be based on six programming projects, one homework, a midterm, and a final exam. For each assignment, a numeric grade will be assigned. Grades will be made available in Canvas. Projects and homeworks are 60% of the course grade, chapter notes are 10%, and the midterm and final exam are each 15%. At the end of the semester, number grades will be converted to letter grades: 90/80/70 are the usual cutoffs for A/B/C grades, respectively. The instructor will exercise discretion on borderline grades, or to account for a trend of increasing/decreasing grades throughout the semester.

If you believe an error has been made in grading an item, please bring it to the attention within seven days of receiving it. Factual and clerical errors will of course be cheerfully corrected. After seven days, graded items are final and will not be revisited.

Late assignments are not generally accepted.  However, each student may use **one late pass** for one quiz/ project during the semester.  To exercise this option,
please email the instructor prior to the deadline.  The late pass will give you an extension of one week on the assignment.  (Cannot be used for the final assignment.)

## Support for Student Mental Health at the London Global Gateway

Students can receive mental health support directly through the weekly on-site counselling service and through local providers covered by GeoBlue insurance. Details for these services can be found on the online Student Portal and in the Conway Hall handbook.  The University's on-campus Care and Wellness Consultants provide support and resources to all students who are experiencing stressful or difficult situations that may be interfering with academic progress, including while abroad.
